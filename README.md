See [iAuction: An Adaptive Payments Tutorial Featuring Parallel Payments](https://www.x.com/docs/DOC-2505) tutorial for more info.

### Init

    gateway =  ActiveMerchant::Billing::PaypalAdaptivePayment.new(
      :login => "acutio_1313133342_biz_api1.gmail.com",
      :password => "1255043567",
      :signature => "Abg0gYcQlsdkls2HDJkKtA-p6pqhA1k-KTYE0Gcy1diujFio4io5Vqjf",
      :appid => "APP-80W284485P519543T" )

### Pre-approved payment

    gateway.preapprove_payment (
      :return_url => "returnURL",
      :cancel_url => "cancelURL",
      :senderEmail =>"email address of sender",
      :start_date => Time.now,
      :end_date => Time.now + (60*60*24) * 30,
      :currency_code =>"currency code",
      :max_amount => "maxTotalAmountOfAllPayments",
      :maxNumberOfPayments => "maxNumberOfPayments" )

### Cancel pre-approved payment

     gateway.cancel_preapproval(:preapproval_key => "preapprovalkey")

### Chained payments

    def checkout
      recipients = [{:email => 'receiver_email',
                     :amount => some_amount,
                     :primary => true},
                    {:email => 'receiver_email',
                     :amount => recipient_amount,
                     :primary => false}
                     ]
      response = gateway.setup_purchase(
        :return_url => url_for(:action => 'action', :only_path => false),
        :cancel_url => url_for(:action => 'action', :only_path => false),
        :ipn_notification_url => url_for(:action => 'notify_action', :only_path => false),
        :receiver_list => recipients
      )

      # for redirecting the customer to the actual paypal site to finish the payment.
      redirect_to (gateway.redirect_url_for(response["payKey"]))
    end

Set the `:primary` flag to `false` for each recipient for a split payment.

Maybe also check the tests for a sample implementation.

Notes:

In `development` environment it's very important to define
ActiveMerchant environment you will be using to test your app like so:

```ruby
#config/environments/{environment.rb}
App::Application.configure do
  config.setting...
end
ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.mode = :test
```

### Setting advanced payment and invoice options

To be able to set additional payment and invoice options, such as item names,
shipping costs, custom logos, etc., you must first create a payment, then set
the options and then direct the user to the payment page:

```ruby
purchase = gateway.setup_purchase(
  :action_type => "CREATE", # This is in contrast to the default PAY action
  …                         # as above
)

gateway.set_payment_options(
  :display_options => {
    :business_name    => "Your Business",
    :header_image_url => "http://cdn.yourbusiness.com/logo-for-paypal.png"
  },
  :pay_key => purchase["payKey"],
  :receiver_options => [
    {
      :description => "Your purchase of XYZ",
      :invoice_data => {
        :item => [
          { :name => "Item #1", :item_count => 1, :item_price => 100, :price => 100 },
          { :name => "Item #2", :item_count => 2, :item_price => 10, :price => 20 }
        ],
        :total_shipping => 5,
        :total_tax => 10
      },
      :receiver => { :email => "receiver1@example.com" }
    },
    {
      :description => "XYZ Processing fee",
      :invoice_data => {
        :item => [{ :name => "Fee", :item_count => 1, :item_price => 10, :price => 10 }]
      },
      :receiver => { :email => "receiver2@example.com" }
    }
  ]
)

redirect_to(gateway.redirect_url_for(purchase["payKey"]))
```

See the implementation of ActiveMerchant::Billing::PaypalAdaptivePayment#build_adaptive_set_payment_options_request
for all available options and [Operation SetPaymentOptions API](https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/PP_AdaptivePayments.pdf)
for a description of them.

## Testing

First modify the `test/fixtures.yml` to fit your app credentials (You
will need at least a PayPal developer account).

After that you can run them like this:

    $ ruby -Ilib test/test_paypal_adaptive_payment.rb

## Debugging

Use either gateway.debug or response.debug this gives you the json
response, the xml sent and the url it was posted to.

From the Rails console it can be accessed like such:

    ActiveMerchant::Billing::PaypalAdaptivePayment

`PaypalAdaptivePayment#debug` or `AdaptivePaymentResponse#debug` return the raw
xml request, raw json response and the URL of the endpoint.

## TODO

* More/better Documentation.
* Improve/change the tests implementation by maybe run them off
  fixture data and use a separate script/test for actually invoking
  requests to PayPal. This will allow other developers to implement
  the without being required to set and request the credentials from
  PayPal process.
